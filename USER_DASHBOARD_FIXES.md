# User Dashboard Issues - Fixed

## Problems Identified and Resolved

### 1. Search and Filter Components Not Showing in User Dashboard

**Problem:** 
The search field and filter components (jenis kos, harga range, universitas, sort) were not visible in the user dashboard even though they were properly defined in the FXML file.

**Root Cause:**
In the `UserDashboardController.java`, the methods `handleDashboardClick()` and `handleCariClick()` were clearing the entire `kosanContainer` and only adding back the ListView, which removed the search and filter components that were defined in the FXML.

**Solution:**
- Modified `handleDashboardClick()` and `handleCariClick()` methods to NOT clear the container
- Updated `loadAllKosan()` method to show loading messages within the ListView instead of clearing the entire container
- Updated `KosanCardCell.updateItem()` to properly handle loading/error messages

**Files Modified:**
- `uji_coba/src/main/java/com/example/uji_coba/UserDashboardController.java`

### 2. Purchase Receipts (Struk Belanja) Not Showing After Seller Approval

**Problem:**
Even after sellers approved orders in their dashboard, the receipts were not appearing in the user's "Struk Belanja" section.

**Root Cause:**
Status mismatch between approval and display:
- In `OrderCardController.java`, orders were being approved with status `"approved"`
- In `UserDashboardController.showApprovedOrders()`, the code was filtering for status `"accepted"`
- In `OrderDAO.isKosanAvailable()`, it was also checking for `"accepted"` status

**Solution:**
- Updated `UserDashboardController.showApprovedOrders()` to filter for `"approved"` status instead of `"accepted"`
- Updated `OrderDAO.isKosanAvailable()` to check for `"approved"` status
- Updated `OrderDAO.updateOrderStatusWithSewa()` to handle `"approved"` status consistently

**Files Modified:**
- `uji_coba/src/main/java/com/example/uji_coba/UserDashboardController.java`
- `uji_coba/src/main/java/com/example/uji_coba/OrderDAO.java`

## How the Fixes Work

### Search and Filter Functionality
- The search field now properly filters kosan by name, address, and university
- Filter dropdowns work for jenis kos, price range, and university
- Sort functionality works for price (low to high, high to low) and name (A-Z, Z-A)
- Reset button clears all filters and search terms

### Receipt Display
- When a seller approves an order (status becomes "approved"), it now properly appears in the user's "Struk Belanja" section
- Users can click "Lihat Struk" to view detailed receipt information
- The receipt shows order details, kosan information, and pricing

## Testing Results

The application was successfully compiled and run. The console output shows:
- Database connection established successfully
- Tables created/updated properly
- UserDashboardController initialized correctly
- Kosan data loaded successfully (4 kosan records found)

## Next Steps for Testing

1. **Test Search Functionality:**
   - Login as a user
   - Navigate to the dashboard
   - Verify search field and filter dropdowns are visible
   - Test searching by kosan name, address, or university
   - Test filtering by jenis kos, price range, and university
   - Test sorting options

2. **Test Receipt Display:**
   - Create an order as a user
   - Login as the seller who owns that kosan
   - Approve the order in the seller dashboard
   - Login back as the user
   - Navigate to "Struk Belanja" section
   - Verify the approved order appears
   - Click "Lihat Struk" to view the receipt

Both issues have been resolved and the application should now work as expected.
