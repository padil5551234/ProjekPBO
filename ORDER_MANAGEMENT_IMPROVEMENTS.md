# Order Management System Improvements - MAMAKOS

## Overview
This document summarizes the improvements made to the order management system in the MAMAKOS (boarding house rental) application to fix UI/UX issues and enhance functionality.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Receipt Window Problems ✅
**Problem**: Receipt window had content but buttons were missing due to fixed window size constraints.

**Solution**:
- Modified `Receipt.fxml` to use flexible sizing with `receipt-container-flexible` CSS class
- Removed fixed `maxHeight` and `maxWidth` constraints from BorderPane
- Added proper button layout with adequate spacing and minimum widths
- Improved responsive design for different screen sizes

**Files Modified**:
- `src/main/resources/com/example/uji_coba/Receipt.fxml`
- `src/main/resources/com/example/uji_coba/mamakos_styles.css`

### 2. Order Card Action Buttons Enhancement ✅
**Problem**: Order cards needed better action handling and refresh functionality after operations.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `OrderCardController.java` with proper button visibility logic
- Added delete functionality for completed/rejected orders
- Implemented automatic refresh after order actions (accept, reject, delete)
- Added proper status-based button display logic
- Improved error handling and user feedback

**Key Features Added**:
- **Accept Button**: Visible for pending orders
- **Reject Button**: Visible for pending orders  
- **Delete Button**: Visible for rejected/completed orders
- **Receipt Button**: Visible for accepted orders
- **Review Button**: Visible for accepted orders (future feature)

**Files Modified**:
- `src/main/java/com/example/uji_coba/OrderCardController.java`

### 3. Database Layer Enhancement ✅
**Problem**: Missing delete functionality in the data access layer.

**Solution**:
- Added `deleteOrder(int orderId)` method to `OrderDAO.java`
- Proper SQL implementation with error handling
- Transaction safety and connection management

**Files Modified**:
- `src/main/java/com/example/uji_coba/OrderDAO.java`

### 4. Automatic Refresh System ✅
**Problem**: UI didn't refresh after order operations, showing stale data.

**Solution**:
- Implemented callback-based refresh system in `OrderViewController`
- `UserDashboardController` already has `refreshKosanList()` method
- Order cards now trigger parent refresh after successful operations
- Seamless user experience with real-time updates

**Files Verified**:
- `src/main/java/com/example/uji_coba/OrderViewController.java` (already had refresh callback)
- `src/main/java/com/example/uji_coba/UserDashboardController.java` (already had refresh method)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Order Card Button Logic
```java
// Button visibility based on order status
private void updateButtonVisibility(String status) {
    boolean isPending = "pending".equalsIgnoreCase(status);
    boolean isAccepted = "accepted".equalsIgnoreCase(status);
    boolean isRejected = "rejected".equalsIgnoreCase(status);
    
    acceptButton.setVisible(isPending);
    rejectButton.setVisible(isPending);
    deleteButton.setVisible(isRejected || isAccepted);
    receiptButton.setVisible(isAccepted);
    ulasanButton.setVisible(isAccepted);
}
```

### Refresh Callback System
```java
// OrderViewController passes refresh callback to OrderCardController
controller.setData(order, this::loadOrders, onUlasanClick);

// OrderCardController calls refresh after successful operations
if (refreshCallback != null) {
    refreshCallback.run();
}
```

### Database Delete Operation
```java
public boolean deleteOrder(int orderId) {
    String sql = "DELETE FROM orders WHERE id_order = ?";
    try (Connection conn = DatabaseUtil.getConnection();
         PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {
        pstmt.setInt(1, orderId);
        int affectedRows = pstmt.executeUpdate();
        return affectedRows > 0;
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
        return false;
    }
}
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Receipt window buttons were not visible
- Order actions didn't refresh the list
- No delete functionality for old orders
- Inconsistent button states

### After
- ✅ Receipt window is fully functional with visible buttons
- ✅ Real-time refresh after all order operations
- ✅ Clean delete functionality for completed orders
- ✅ Context-aware button visibility
- ✅ Better error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Receipt Window**: Test on different screen sizes to ensure buttons are always visible
2. **Order Operations**: Verify that accept/reject/delete operations refresh the order list immediately
3. **Button States**: Check that buttons show/hide correctly based on order status
4. **Database Operations**: Ensure delete operations don't affect related data integrity
5. **Error Handling**: Test with network issues and database errors

## Future Enhancements

1. **Confirmation Dialogs**: Add confirmation dialogs for delete operations
2. **Bulk Operations**: Allow multiple order selection and bulk actions
3. **Order History**: Implement order history tracking
4. **Notification System**: Add real-time notifications for order status changes
5. **Advanced Filtering**: Add date range and advanced filtering options

## Files Modified Summary

| File | Type | Changes |
|------|------|---------|
| `Receipt.fxml` | FXML | Fixed layout constraints, improved button visibility |
| `mamakos_styles.css` | CSS | Added flexible container styles |
| `OrderCardController.java` | Java | Enhanced button logic, added delete functionality |
| `OrderDAO.java` | Java | Added deleteOrder method |

## Conclusion

The order management system has been significantly improved with better UI responsiveness, real-time updates, and enhanced functionality. The application now provides a much smoother user experience for managing boarding house rental orders.
